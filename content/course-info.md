#### Webpage:

All the handouts, slides, problem sheets and solutions will be available
in PDF and HTML format from [Moodle](https://moody.st-andrews.ac.uk/moodle/course/view.php?id=12564). Solutions will be posted only after
all relevant tutorials have happened.

The lecture notes and handouts will contain a number of extra examples.
I will not have time to cover these in the lectures themselves, but they
are intended to be useful supplementary material.
