## What is linear mathematics?

The aims of this module are stated on the School website as:

> "This module continues the study of vector spaces and linear
> transformations begun in MT2501. It aims to show the importance of
> linearity in many areas of mathematics ranging from linear algebra
> through to geometric applications to linear operators and special
> functions. The main topics covered include: diagonalisation and the
> minimum polynomial; Jordan normal form; inner product spaces;
> orthonormal sets and the Gram-Schmidt process; adjoint and
> self-adjoint operators."

The study of linear algebra comprises three central components:

1.  mathematical underpinnings (i.e. theorems and their proofs);

2.  computation (for instance, computing the eigenvectors of a linear
    transformation);

3.  geometric understanding (for example, finding answers to: why is
    matrix multiplication defined the way it is, what is the meaning of
    the determinant of a matrix, and so on?).

After MT2501, you are probably most familiar with the computational
aspects of linear algebra. In this module, we will concentrate in equal
parts on the mathematical underpinnings and computation (although not
exactly in the same sense as you did in MT2501), and, to a somewhat
lesser extent to geometric understanding.

## Why is linear mathematics important?

Linear algebra arises out of the study of matrices and vectors. In
MT1002, or equivalent previous mathematical studies, we have seen how
matrices arise naturally in two settings, first in the context of
solving systems of linear equations and second as specifying certain
geometric transformations. Vectors also arise naturally in the geometric
setting of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional real space. In this course,
we shall see how the concept of a vector space has been generalised from
its geometric origins to an algebraic object which has applications in a
range of different settings:

-   pure mathematics (e.g., geometry, algebra, functional analysis,
    etc.),

-   applied mathematics (e.g., spaces of solutions to differential
    equations, etc.),

-   physics (e.g., quantum mechanics, etc.),

-   etc.

## Overview of course content

1.  **Review of the prerequisites from MT2501**

    -   vector spaces, elementary row operations, subspaces;

    -   linear independence and bases: spanning sets, linear
        independence, bases, dimension;

    -   linear transformations: matrix of a linear transformation, rank
        and nullity, change of basis; isomorphisms of vector spaces;

    -   eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and diagonalisation.

2.  **Vector space constructions (new vector spaces from old)**

    -   the vector space $\mathcal{L}(V, W)$ of linear transformations
        from a vector space $V$ to another vector space $W$;

    -   direct sums, projection maps;

    -   the dual space $V ^ * = \mathcal{L}(V,F)$;

    -   the transpose of a linear transformation;

    -   the quotient space and quotient linear transformation.

3.  **Invariants of vector spaces under change of basis**

    -   more about eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and eigenspaces;

    -   characteristic polynomial;

    -   the Cayley-Hamilton theorem;

    -   diagonalizability;

    -   minimum polynomial;

    -   Jordan normal form: method for determining the Jordan normal
        form.

4.  **Advanced material**

    -   Inner products

    -   Maybe more $\ldots$

## Comment about lecture content

The lecture notes are available on moodle in PDF and HTML format. The
notes contain a number of examples that will not be covered in any
classes. This is an attempt to provide more examples, while not
decreasing the amount of material covered. These omitted examples are
numbered in the form "**2.1A**" (etc.) in these notes.
