### What is linear mathematics?

The aims of this module are stated on the School website as:

> "This module continues the study of vector spaces and linear
> transformations begun in MT2501. It aims to show the importance of
> linearity in many areas of mathematics ranging from linear algebra
> through to geometric applications to linear operators and special
> functions. The main topics covered include: diagonalisation and the
> minimum polynomial; Jordan normal form; inner product spaces;
> orthonormal sets and the Gram-Schmidt process; adjoint and
> self-adjoint operators."

The study of linear algebra comprises three central components:

(1) mathematical underpinnings (i.e. theorems and their proofs);

(2) computation (for instance, computing the eigenvectors of a linear
    transformation);

(3) geometric understanding (for example, finding answers to: why is
    matrix multiplication defined the way it is, what is the meaning of
    the determinant of a matrix, and so on?).

After MT2501, you are probably most familiar with item (2). In this module, we
will concentrate in equal parts on (1) and (2), and, to a somewhat lesser
extent (3).

### Why is linear mathematics important?

Linear algebra arises out of the study of matrices and vectors. In
MT1002, or equivalent previous mathematical studies, we have seen how
matrices arise naturally in two settings, first in the context of
solving systems of linear equations and second as specifying certain
geometric transformations. Vectors also arise naturally in the geometric
setting of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional real space. In this course,
we shall see how the concept of a vector space has been generalised from
its geometric origins to an algebraic object which has applications in a
range of different settings:

-   pure mathematics (e.g., geometry, algebra, functional analysis,
    etc.),

-   applied mathematics (e.g., spaces of solutions to differential
    equations, etc.),

-   physics (e.g., quantum mechanics, etc.),

-   etc.

### Comment about lecture content

The lecture notes are available online. TODO more about accessibility

The notes contain a number of
examples that will not be covered in any classes. This is an attempt to
provide more examples, while not decreasing the amount of material
covered. These omitted examples are numbered in the form "**1A**" (etc.)
in these notes.
